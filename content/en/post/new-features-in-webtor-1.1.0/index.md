Here is a list of new features:

1. **In-place player** - from this moment all video and images are opening just below selected file. There is no need to scroll up to find the player anymore!
2. **Copy stream url** - now you can copy currently playing video stream url and place it to VLC or any other player. Just go to player settings page and find "Copy stream url" button.
3. **Current revision** - at the top left corner here is a small revision number with the link to release notes (page like this).
4. **Reduced script size** - there was a lot of work done to reduce size of all script bundles up to 3 times. Now **Webtor** loads faster after updates.

That's all folks!
