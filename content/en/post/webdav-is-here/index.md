Thanks to your support, another big feature just landed — WebDAV access to your Webtor library.

You can now mount your whole torrent collection as a network folder on desktop or mobile. Stream directly from your library — or just copy your stuff locally.

And yes — you can upload new torrents too — just drop .torrent files into the `torrents/` folder. That’s it. 🤘

🧩 Works great with:

* Mountain Duck (macOS/Windows)
* RaiDrive (Windows)
* Owlfiles (iOS / Android) — tested and working without hassle
* rclone — for CLI and selfhosted automation fans

💬 If you tried any other client — and it worked or didn’t — feel free to message me or comment here. The more we know, the better the experience for everyone.

🔐 As always, WebDAV access is available for paid users — grab your personal link from your Webtor profile and plug it in.

✊ Thank you for keeping this project alive.

More fun features are coming soon — stay tuned.
