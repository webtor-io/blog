Latest release of this year!

Before announcing the list of changes, I want to share with you great news!

**In anticipation of the upcoming holidays, the speed has been increased for all who support the project!**

* Bronze Backer 15Mbit/s => 20Mbit/s
* Silver Backer 25Mbit/s => 50Mbit/s
* Gold Backer   50Mbit/s => 100Mbit/s

And here is the list of changes itself:

1. **Support for Zip64** - now there is no limit on the size of files placed in a ZIP archive, previously there was a limit of 4GB.
(I'm also thinking about supporting the TAR format, write if someone else is also interested in this!)
2. **Resumed support for Google Chromecast** - now you can immediately stream your content to any device with support of
Google Chromecast. During playback, the corresponding icon appears in the upper right corner of the player.

Thanks to your support, [part of the project moved to Open Source](https://github.com/webtor-io/), which allowed great projects to appear:

1. [Papaya player](https://papayaplayer.com/) - the project aggregates films and tv shows from popular torrent trackers and allows
watch them online.

Thank you for using [webtor.io](https://webtor.io/) and [sponsor it](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=24145874) if you wish!

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! 🎄🎄🎄
