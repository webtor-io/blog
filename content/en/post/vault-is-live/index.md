We’ve just launched one of Webtor’s core features — Vault.

Vault lets you keep torrents available even when there are no seeders.
If a torrent matters to you, you can now make sure it stays online and accessible.

⸻

🧱 **How Vault works**

Each membership tier now includes Vault Points (VP):
- 1 Vault Point = 1 GB
- You can invest Vault Points into a torrent
- As long as your points are invested, the torrent stays available in Vault
- When your subscription is active, your funded torrents remain accessible

Vault is especially useful for:
- rare or old torrents
- personal libraries
- instant access without waiting for peers

⸻

🎟 **Vault Points by tier**
- **Bronze ($2)** — 50 Vault Points (50 GB)
- **Silver ($5)** — 250 Vault Points (250 GB)
- **Gold ($15)** — 1000 Vault Points (1 TB)

You decide which torrents to support and how to distribute your points.

📘 **Learn more**

We’ve prepared detailed documentation explaining:
- how funding works
- what happens when points are frozen or released
- how long torrents stay available

Vault is a big step toward a more reliable, user-funded Webtor.  
As always — thank you for supporting the project ❤️
