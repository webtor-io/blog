Quite often I get asked questions about how secure it is to use **Webtor** and how does using **Webtor**
differ from using a regular **BitTorrent**.

It also turned out that in some countries the use of **BitTorrent**-networks for downloading this or that content
can be potentially dangerous and lead to substantial fines (eg in Germany).

To understand this issue, let's understand the principles of the **webtor.io** service.

1. When visiting the **webtor.io** website, the user always opens a secure **SSL**-connection and
all further requests between the client and the server are transmitted encrypted using the **HTTPS**-protocol.
2. At the time of downloading content, only webtor servers connects to **BitTorrent**-peers.
For the end-user, downloading a file from **Webtor** is no different than downloading from any
other file hosting service, and watching a video is similar to watching a video from a **Tube**-site.
3. **Webtor** servers work like regular **BitTorrent**-clients. Thus, through **Webtor** you can load
any torrents that could be downloaded through a regular **BitTorrent**-client (including torrent files from private trackers),
but without revealing the real **IP**-addresses for the rest of the **BitTorrent**-network users

Thus, it is not necessary to use **VPN**-services when visiting **Webtor** and
downloading torrents via **Webtor** is anonymous and secure.
