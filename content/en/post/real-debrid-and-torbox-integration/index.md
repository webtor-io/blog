You can now connect Real-Debrid and Torbox accounts in Webtor as custom streaming backends.

They’ll act as additional caches for Stremio — giving you faster playback and more available streams.

### 🧩 How it works
1. Go to Webtor Profile
2. Scroll to the **Streaming Backends** section
3. Add your API key from Real-Debrid or Torbox
4. Set the priority order — which backend should be used first (don't forget to click "Save" button)

If the content isn’t found in any Debrid cache, Webtor’s own streaming engine will be used as a fallback, so playback always works.

### 🔮 What’s next
Next up — **Vault**: your permanent content storage.

Add a movie or series once, and it stays available forever, even when all seeds are gone.

This will be the foundation for your personal, persistent media library.
