Here is a list of new October's features:

1. **Download ZIP-archive** - now you can push **"Download as ZIP-archive"** button and downloading of the current folder will start immediately.
But there might be some delay in case if there is no available peers.
2. **"Share" button** - yes, you had share ability earlier as well, but now we have separate button. On click it will show dropdown with
all available social networks.
