Meet web-ui version 2!

The back was completely rewritten from Node.js to Golang, and the front became as lightweight as possible.

What's new?

1. **Dark and light themes** - now you can change the interface settings depending on your
preferences (the system color scheme will be used by default).
2. **Authorization** - authorization used to be only through Patreon, now you can log in
simply using your email address.
3. **Clear progress** - now you can see how the process of preparing the torrent for playback is going on
and the jump and at what specific stage the problem arose.
4. **Improved download speed** - the volume of downloaded scripts and styles has been reduced by 5 times!
