Hey friends! 👋

We’ve just released a huge improvement to Webtor Library — and we think you’re going to love it.

Now, when you open your Library, you’ll see new sections for Movies and Series — automatically created based on the torrents you’ve added.

It’s a cleaner, smarter way to browse your saved content.

No more endless torrent lists — just organized, beautiful media.

What’s next?
Soon you’ll be able to:

📺 Stream your Library directly through Stremio

💾 Make your Library eternal — content will remain available even if torrent seeders disappear (available for paid users)

Right now, availability depends on seeders — but we’re working on making your Library truly yours, forever.

Thank you 🙏
Thanks for being part of this journey. Your support makes features like this possible. ❤️
