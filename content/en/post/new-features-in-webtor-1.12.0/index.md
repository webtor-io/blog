Here's a list of the key changes:

1. **Ô∏èProgressive enhancement for video formats** - previously popular video-content was only cached to avoid the need of periodic
trnasmitting from the BitTorrent-network. Now the video is deferredly converted to various formats for optimal mobile playback
(adaptive bitrate streaming).
2. **Improved loading of cached HLS-fragments** - now cached fragments are loaded with lookahead, thus on request
the necessary fragment has already been preloaded to the edge-server from the main cache-storage.
