Big milestone! 🎉

We’ve just made Webtor and Torrentio (and other Stremio addons) work together  🚀

Now Webtor can stream not only your library, but also any content coming from Stremio addons.

Here’s how it works under the hood:

* Webtor queries all your connected Stremio addons (up to 3)
* Duplicates are removed (deduplication)
* Results are filtered by your preferred quality (720p / 1080p / 4K)
* Every stream is enriched with a direct Webtor streaming link

So now you can stream not only your personal library, but also any content from Stremio addons — instantly.

This update turns Webtor into a full Stremio streaming layer.

Try it out and let me know how it works for you 🙌
