First release of this year!

Here's a list of the key changes:

1. **Expanded list of supported formats** - added support for video files with .ts and .vob extensions.
2. **Instant switching between audio tracks** - previously, when an alternative audio track was selected,
playback started from the very beginning. Now all tracks are converted at the same time, allowing you
to switch between them on the fly. The selection of audio tracks has been moved to the subtitles menu.
3. **Content caching has been improved** - during playback, the following fragments are loaded in the background,
which makes smoother playback. Also, transcoded fragments began to be cached.
4. **Minor interface improvements** - added an indication of the file size in the listing, rounded corners of elements.
