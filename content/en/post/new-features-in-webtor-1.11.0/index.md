Here's a list of the key changes:

1. **Ô∏èDownload has become clearer and more convenient** - now, when downloading, a separate form opens with the progress of the download, and the ability to copy the download link. It is also possible to generate a bash command to download via [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).
2. **Player SDK has now been renamed to Embed SDK** - at some point it became clear that **webtor** could be integrated not only in the form of a player and the "Player SDK" name would be misleading.
3. **You can now download the torrent as an archive on your website** - [Embed SDK](https://github.com/webtor-io/embed-sdk-js) can now, in addition to the player, integrate a download form similar to download form at [webtor.io](https://webtor.io).
4. **Improved MP4 streaming at 1080p** - improved MP4 playback at 1080p, reduced latency during playback (on desktop).
5. **Fixed transcoding content errors** - there was an error with a delay in the start of playback.
