Hey friends! 👋

Today I’m excited to share a new feature we’ve just launched in Webtor:

**Personal Library** — now you can easily save torrents you like into your personal space! Just click “Add to Library” under any loaded torrent. 🎯

You can:
* Save favorite torrents
* Sort your library by newest or by name

But that’s not all!

Coming soon:
* **Automatic movie metadata fetching** — Webtor will recognize movies in your library and fetch posters, titles, descriptions, and more!
* **Integration with Stremio** — stream your library content directly through Stremio!

Thank you so much for your support — you’re making this possible. 🙏
