Weâ€™ve revamped the transcoding system and introduced some exciting new features:
### Faster Transcoding Startup
Previously, transcoding was initiated in a separate container, which took additional time to launch. Now, transcoding starts immediately without delays.
### Efficient Caching
Transcoding results are now cached more effectively. Content is only removed when itâ€™s no longer in use, rather than based on a fixed time limit.

In addition, the improved transcoding system has reduced our reliance on Kubernetes cluster components. This paves the way for us to release a single Docker image version of webtor.io early next year!

These are our updates just in time for the New Year and Christmas! Wishing you all happy holidays! ðŸŽ„
