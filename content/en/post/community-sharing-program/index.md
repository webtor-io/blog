Love Webtor? Want to support the project without spending money?

Now you can — by helping others discover it.

We’re launching a simple community sharing program:

mention Webtor in relevant places — and get free premium access as a thank-you.

✨ How It Works
Just share Webtor where it makes sense — on Reddit, in Telegram or Discord groups, on your blog or social media — anywhere people discuss torrents and streaming.

Then send us either:

a link to your post or comment, or

a screenshot (if it’s from a private group or chat)

📧 Email it to support@webtor.io from the address you’d like to receive premium access on.

🎁 What You Get
🟫 1 mention → 1 month of Bronze access

⚪ 3 mentions → 1 month of Silver access

🟡 5+ mentions → 1 month of Gold access

You can unlock higher tiers at any time — just keep sharing!

(And please: make it helpful and respectful — no spam 🙏)

💡 Where to Share?
Here are some good places to start:

Reddit:
* /r/Piracy
* /r/VPNTorrents
* /r/Stremio
* /r/seedboxes
* /r/RealDebrid

Telegram or Discord groups related to torrenting, streaming, or privacy

Your blog, YouTube comments, or social media (Twitter, Mastodon, etc.)

Thanks for being part of the Webtor community — your support helps us grow and stay independent ❤️
