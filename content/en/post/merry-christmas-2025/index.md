Hey friends,

Merry Christmas 🎄 and Happy New Year!

Before the year ends, I want to sincerely thank everyone who supports Webtor.

This year we didn’t just add features — we turned Webtor into a more complete and useful tool.

What we built together this year:
* **User Libraries** — your personal space for saved content
* **WebDAV** — mount Webtor as a drive and work with files directly
* **Stremio integration** — including full support for Stremio addons
* **Debrid service integration** — Real-Debrid, TorBox, and others

Your support doesn’t just pay for servers — it buys time, focus, and the freedom to build things properly.

As a small Christmas gift 🎁, we’re offering 25% off on all Webtor tiers for a limited time — a simple thank-you for being part of this journey.

Next year is about going deeper:
* Improving libraries and Vault concepts
* Smoother UX and stronger integrations
* More stability, less friction

Thank you for believing in this project and sticking around.

🎄 Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and see you on the other side of the calendar.
