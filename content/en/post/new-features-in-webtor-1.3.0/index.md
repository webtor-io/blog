Here is a list of new features:

1. **Dark/Light mode** - now **webtor.io** will automatically switch theme according to your system preferences.
Also it is possible to switch between modes with "Dark/Light mode" button at the right top corner of the screen (near language selector).
This blog gains this feature too (but without switch button).
2. **Sponsor access** - if you [become a sponsor](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=24145874) somehow then you can access additional features with special **sponsor access**.
Just click "Already a Sponsor? Login here!" link near "Sponsor" button and you will be authorized through **Patreon**.
If you have any active tiers then all connected offers will be activated. ([Learn more about tiers...](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=24145874))
3. **Open-sourcing** - here is one thing that people sometimes asking me. It is "How to run webtor at my own server?".
I haven't planned it before, but now I decided to start open-sourcing all parts of this project (backend, frontend and Google Chrome Extension).
This task is not simple and can take a lot of time and effort.
But something was already made right now. [Here it is!](https://github.com/webtor-io/).


Thank you for using [webtor.io](https://webtor.io/en/) and [sponsor it](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=24145874) if you wish!
