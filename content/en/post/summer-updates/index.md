Hey everyone 👋

Just wanted to share some small but important updates that have just landed on Webtor — all thanks to your support.

✅ What’s new:

🔐 **Google login** — I noticed that around 70% of users log in with Google email anyway, so I decided to make things more straightforward by adding a simple Google login option.

🎁 **Patreon login** — There were a lot of issues where users struggled to get their benefits from paid subscriptions (especially those who used Apple login on Patreon). Now every backer can simply log in with their Patreon account — no more issues.

⚡ **New 25Gbit/s server** — I just switched to a new server with a total bandwidth of 25 Gbit/s. It’s automatically used for all paid users. This should significantly improve download and streaming performance.

🧪 Coming soon:

📁 **WebDAV support** — You’ll be able to mount your Webtor library directly in Infuse, VLC, or even as a remote folder in your file manager.

🔍 **Torznab support** — Soon you’ll be able to use Webtor with apps like Jackett, Sonarr, Radarr, and others.

🎥 I’m also planning to make some video tutorials to showcase the best ways to use Webtor!

Thanks again for being part of this — and if you ever have questions, ideas, or just want to say hi, feel free to DM me anytime.
