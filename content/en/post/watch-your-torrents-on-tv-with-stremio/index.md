We’ve been slowly moving toward this — and now it’s finally here.

The personal library feature was just a stop on the way.

The real goal was always this: streaming your own torrents directly on your TV, with no downloads, no VPN, and no torrent client. Just press play.

And now it works. It’s been live for a full day in production — and I’m absolutely happy with how it performs.

📦 Add any torrent to your Webtor library

📺 Open Stremio and install your personal addon

🍿 Start watching on any device — even your TV

Metadata is detected automatically. Works with both movies and series.

(Available for paid users only — thank you for supporting this.)

🔮 What’s next?
We have exciting plans for the near future:

**Vault** — a permanent personal library that persists across time and torrents

**Torznab integration** — so you can search and add content directly from public or private indexers

💭 A personal note
For years, my flow was always the same —

search for torrents on tracker sites, upload them to my NAS, organize everything, and finally stream through Plex.

It worked, but it was clunky. Too many moving parts.

Now, with Webtor + Stremio, one entire step is gone. No more NAS uploads, no more media servers. Just add a torrent — and watch.

And I genuinely love this shift.

It feels like the way torrenting should work in 2025 — smooth, private, and effortless.

Thank you for being part of this.

This project wouldn’t exist without your support.

If you have feedback or questions — just drop me a message.
