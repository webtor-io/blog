I present to your attention the Webtor API! :tada::tada::tada:

Webtor API allows you to:

1. Download torrent content without usage of BitTorrent-client.
2. Stream content instantly with on-the-fly transcoding. Webtor generates HLS-streams suitable for web-streaming.
3. Fetch [OpenSubtitles.org](https://www.opensubtitles.org/) for torrent content.

Great and how to access it? There are two options to choose from here:
1. Host it on your hardware as part of a [self-hosted solution](https://github.com/webtor-io/helm-charts).
2. Connect via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/paveltatarsky-Dx4aX7s_XBt/api/webtor/).
