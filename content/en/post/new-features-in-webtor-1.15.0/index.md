**Webtor** has finally moved completely to Open Source, what does this mean:
1. All code for all project components is now [publicly available on Github](https://github.com/webtor-io).
2. Now it is possible to deploy **Webtor** at home. [Installation script attached](https://github.com/webtor-io/helm-charts).

Future plans:
1. Add REST-API, this should make it easier to programmatically use the service.
2. Implement support for external HTTP links as a source.
