 Host it on your hardware as part of a self-hosted solution. Connect via RapidAPI.  Thank you for using webtor.</description>

      <description>Webtor has finally moved completely to Open Source, what does this mean:
 All code for all project components is now publicly available on Github. Now it is possible to deploy Webtor at home. Installation script attached.  Future plans:
 Add REST-API, this should make it easier to programmatically use the service. Implement support for external HTTP links as a source.  Thank you for using webtor.io and sponsor it if you wish!</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the key changes:
  Ô∏èResume download bug fixed - now, in the case of a failure during downloading, resuming works correctly, this applies to downloads of both individual files and downloads in a ZIP archive.
  Fewer drops and crashes - earlier, during component releases, all downloads were interrupted, now they just pause at the time of the update.
  Torrent files live forever - previously torrent files were deleted after a certain time, now they are saved forever, this allows less frequent access to the BitTorrent network and improves response time.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the key changes:
 Ô∏èProgressive enhancement for video formats - previously popular video-content was only cached to avoid the need of periodic trnasmitting from the BitTorrent-network. Now the video is deferredly converted to various formats for optimal mobile playback (adaptive bitrate streaming). Improved loading of cached HLS-fragments - now cached fragments are loaded with lookahead, thus on request the necessary fragment has already been preloaded to the edge-server from the main cache-storage.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the key changes:
 Ô∏èDownload has become clearer and more convenient - now, when downloading, a separate form opens with the progress of the download, and the ability to copy the download link. It is also possible to generate a bash command to download via Wget. Player SDK has now been renamed to Embed SDK - at some point it became clear that webtor could be integrated not only in the form of a player and the &amp;ldquo;Player SDK&amp;rdquo; name would be misleading.</description>

      <description>This release was mainly focused on stability and fixing performance issues of the service.
The most affected component was transcoding. Here is a short list of changes:
 Dropped HEVC-support - transcoding from HEVC(x265) to h264(x264) is a really heavy lifting that freezes work of whole service. Dropped &amp;ldquo;fast forward&amp;rdquo; functionality - now transcoding starts always from the beginning. It makes possible to just repack stream to HLS instead of &amp;ldquo;real transcoding&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This minor update solves annoying problem with automatic opening of downloaded torrent-files on several sites (yts.am for example).
To make it working we need to check that &amp;ldquo;Allow Access to file URLs&amp;rdquo; option is enabled. Follow these steps:
We need to be sure that Webtor.io extension is already installed. Go to Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s extensions page    Find Webtor.io extension and click &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo;    Option &amp;ldquo;Allow Access to file URLs&amp;rdquo; should be activated     After accomplishing these steps you should not meet any problems with opening of downloaded torrent-files.</description>
