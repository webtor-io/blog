      <description>Quite often I get asked questions about how secure it is to use Webtor and how does using Webtor differ from using a regular BitTorrent.
It also turned out that in some countries the use of BitTorrent-networks for downloading this or that content can be potentially dangerous and lead to substantial fines (eg in Germany).

To begin with, Webtor has made a 3-year-long journey from a monolithic application living on a dedicated server to the introduction of microservices, containerization, and moving to the Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. Currently, about 10 different services are running in the cluster and 100+ simultaneous jobs are running for downloading torrents and transcoding content.</description>
